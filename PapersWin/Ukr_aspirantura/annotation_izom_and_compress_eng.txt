The aim of the work is to construct requirements which describes isometrical functions over the ring of
integer 2-adic numbers. 
This work 
devoted to the possibility of providing 
automorphisms of homogeneous rooted tree with 2-adic isometries.
This paper continues investigations of 2-adic groups’ automatous with the 2-adic isometrical functions’
technique. Izometric and compression functions build the important class of 2-adic function  to describe the group automatous that’s why we investigate them in this
paper.
