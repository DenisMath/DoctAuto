\section{Introduction}


The automorphism group of an infinite regular  rooted tree is rich
of free subgroups (\cite{Bh}). But finding concrete examples of
such subgroups, especially generated by finite state
automorphisms, is a challenging task. One way to give such
examples is to construct a faithful action of the free product of
some finite groups on a rooted tree and then to choose therein
some free subgroup.  Note the following examples of free products
generated by finite state automorphisms. The free product of $n$
($n \ge 3$) cyclic groups of order $2$ over binary tree presented
by the author (\cite{O}). The free product of infinite number of
cyclic groups of order $2$ over binary tree established  by
M.~Brunner and S.~Sidki (\cite{BS}). The free product of finite
number of cyclic groups of order $2$ over binary tree, generated
by an automaton (i.e. an
 example of self-similar action), constructed by D.~Savchuk and Y.~Vorobets \cite{SV}. In
this note it is proved that the free product of finite number of
arbitrary finite groups is generated by  automorphisms with
exactly two states of some regular rooted tree.


\section{Automorphisms of rooted trees}

Let $n$ be an integer, $n\ge 2$. By $\mathcal{T}_n$ it is denoted
a rooted regular tree of degree $n$ (it means that its root has
degree $n$ and all other vertices $n+1$). The rooted subtree,
rooted at arbitrary vertex of $\mathcal{T}_n$ is isomorphic to the
whole tree.  For each vertex let us fix some isomorphism and
enumerate vertices connected to the root. Denote by
$\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$ the automorphism group of $\mathcal{T}_n$.
This group splits into the permutational wreath product of the
symmetric group $S_n$ of degree $n$ and itself (\cite{Z}), i.e.
\[
\Aut\mathcal{T}_n \simeq S_n \Wr \Aut\mathcal{T}_n = S_n \ltimes (\Aut\mathcal{T}_n)^n.
\]
This means that each automorphism $g \in \Aut\mathcal{T}_n$ is
uniquely representable as  $(g_1,\dots,g_n)\sigma$, where
$g_1,\dots,g_n\in \Aut\mathcal{T}_n$ and $\sigma\in S_n$. The
automorphisms $g_1,\dots,g_n$ act on rooted subtrees whose roots
connected with the root of $\mathcal{T}_n$ and the permutation
$\sigma$ permutes these subtrees.  We refer to automorphisms
$g_1,g_2, \ldots, g_n$ as to  states (or sections, projections) of
the first level of $g$ and to $\sigma$ as to rooted permutation of
$g$. By states of the second level of $g$ we mean  states of the
first level of $g_1,g_2,
\ldots, g_n$. Inductively we define states of the $k$-th level of
$g$ for every natural $k$. The state of the $0$-th level of $g$ is
$g$ itself. Therefore, for each vertex $v$ of the tree
$\mathcal{T}_n$ the state $g_v$ of $g$ at this vertex is defined.
The rooted permutation of this state is called the permutation at
the vertex $v$ of $g$. An automorphism $g
\in
\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$ is called finite state automorphism if $g$ has
only finite number of different states. All finite state
automorphisms form a subgroups $FA_n$ in $\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$.
Subgroups of $FA_n$ are called finitely automatic.

Denote by $e$ the identity transformation. Note, that we use the
right action of transformations. In particular, for automorphisms
$g=(g_1,\dots,g_n)\sigma$ and $h=(h_1,\dots,h_n)\tau$ one obtain
their product $g\cdot h$ as
\[(g_1h_{1^{\sigma}},\dots,g_nh_{n^{\sigma}})\sigma \tau.
\]
More generally, for arbitrary vertex $v \in \mathcal{T}_n$ and
corresponding states $g_v$, $h_v$ the state of their product
$(g\cdot h)_v$ can be expressed as $g_v \cdot h_{v^g}$.


\section{Main result}

\begin{thm}
Let $G_1, \ldots , G_m$ be some finite groups, $m \ge 2$. Then for
sufficiently large $n$ the group $\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$ contains a
subgroup, generated by automorphisms with exactly $2$ states, that
isomorphic to the free product $G_1 *\ldots * G_m$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
For a suitable $n$ we define explicitly a subgroup of
$\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$, generated by two-states automorphisms, that
admits a factorization required.

Let the orders of groups $G_1, \ldots , G_m$ are equal $n_1,
\ldots, n_m$ correspondingly. For each group $G_i$ consider a set
$X_i$ of cardinality $n_i$, $1 \le i \le m$. Suppose additionally
that
\[
|X_i\cap X_j|=1, i \ne j, \text{ and }
\bigcap_{i=1}^{m}X_i=1,
\] i.e. each two sets intersects on the
unique, common for all sets, element. Denote this element by
$\epsilon$. Let $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^{m}X_i$ and $n=|X|$. Then
\[n=n_1+\ldots +n_m -m+1.\] The set $X$ is the set of indices.

For each $i$, $1 \le i \le m$, fix a (right) regular action
$\rho_i$ of the group $G_i$ on the set $X_i$. Extend this action
trivially on the set $X$. For an element $g \in G_i$ denote by
$\pi_g$ the corresponding permutation of $X$. For $x \in X$ we get
\[
x^{\pi_g}=
\begin{cases}
x^{\rho_i(g)} & \text{ if } x \in X_i \\
x & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}.
\]

Consider a rooted tree $\mathcal{T}_n$ and use $X$ to enumerate
its vertices connected to the root. As for each vertex of
$\mathcal{T}_n$ an isomorphism between $\mathcal{T}_n$ and the
rooted subtree rooted at this vertex is fixed one can label each
vertex of $\mathcal{T}_n$ by a finite sequence of elements from
$X$. For each element $g
\in G_i$, $1 \le i \le m$, let us define two automorphisms $a_g$
and $b_g$ of the tree $\mathcal{T}_n$. We put
\[
a_g=(c_{g,x}, x \in X)\pi_g, \quad b_g=(c_{g,x}, x \in X)e,
\]
where
\[
c_{g,x}=
\begin{cases}
a_g & \text{ if } x \in X \setminus X_i \\
b_g & \text{ if } x \in X_i
\end{cases}.
\]
Automorphisms $a_g$ and $b_g$ have exactly $2$ states, $a_g$ and
$b_g$, and differ only by their rooted permutations. This
definition is correct. Note, that for the identity element $e$,
taken from arbitrary group $G_i$, both automorphisms $a_e$ and
$b_e$ are equal to the identity automorphism $e$ of
$\mathcal{T}_n$. For different nontrivial $g,h \in
\cup_{i=1}^{m}G_i$ elements in both pairs $a_g$, $a_h$  and $b_g$,
$b_h$  are different and nontrivial for their rooted permutations
are different and nontrivial.

Denote by $A$ (correspondingly, by $B$) the subgroup of
$\Aut\mathcal{T}_n$, generated by all elements $a_g$
(correspondingly, $b_g$), where $g \in G_i$, $1 \le i \le m$. Then
these two groups are isomorphic to the free product $G_1 *\ldots *
G_m$. To complete the proof of the theorem, let us show that $A$
admits such a factorization. For $B$ the proof  is the same.

Firstly, for each $i$, $1 \le i \le m$, the group $A_i$, generated
by elements $a_g$, $g \in G_i$, is isomorphic to $G_i$. In fact,
$A_i$ consists of these elements and the rule $g \mapsto a_g$ is
an isomorphism. Indeed, for arbitrary $g,h \in G_i$ we obtain
\begin{multline*}
a_g \cdot a_h=\\ (c_{g,x} \cdot c_{h,x^{\pi_g}}, x \in X)\pi_g\pi_h=\\
(c_{g,x}\cdot c_{h,x}, x \in X)\pi_{gh}
\end{multline*}
as $X_i$ is invariant under $\pi_g$ and  the value of the state
$c_{h,x}$, $x
\in X$, depends only on the condition $x \in X_i$ or not. Then for each $x \in X$ the
state $c_{g,x}\cdot c_{h,x}$ equals to $a_g \cdot a_h$ or $b_g
\cdot b_h$.   Obviously we have
\[
b_g \cdot b_h=(c_{g,x}c_{h,x}, x \in X).
\]
This means that the rooted permutation of the product $a_g \cdot
a_h$ is equal to the one of $a_{gh}$. The same is true for their
corresponding states of the first level, and so on. Hence, $a_g
\cdot a_h=a_{gh}$.

Secondly, we show, that the group $A$ splits into the free product
$A_1*\ldots * A_m$. It is enough to show, that for arbitrary $k\ge
1$, indices $i_1,\ldots, i_k \in \{1, \ldots, m \}$ such that $i_j
\ne i_{j+1}$ ($1 \le j \le k-1$) and nontrivial elements $g_1 \in G_{i_1}, \ldots , g_k \in G_{i_k}$
the product $a_{g_1}\cdot \ldots \cdot a_{g_k}$ is a nontrivial
automorphism of the tree $\mathcal{T}_n$. Denote by $v_k$ the
vertex of $\mathcal{T}_n$ labelled by $\underbrace{\epsilon \ldots
\epsilon}_{k}$ and let $v_0$ be the root of $\mathcal{T}_n$. We prove by induction on $k$ the following
statement about permutations at these vertices of the product
$a_{g_1}\cdot \ldots \cdot a_{g_k}$. The permutation at the vertex
$v_{k-1}$  equals $\pi_{g_k}$ and therefore nontrivial while the
permutations at  vertices $v_l$, $l\ge k$, are trivial.  The case
$k=1$ is easily verified by the definition of $a_{g_1}$. Let the
statement is proved for $k-1$. Consider the  permutation at the
vertex $v_{l}$, $l \ge k-1$ of $a_{g_1}\cdot
\ldots \cdot a_{g_k}$. It equals to the product of the permutation at $v_{l}$ of $a_{g_1}\cdot
\ldots
\cdot a_{g_{k-1}}$ which is trivial by the assumption of induction and the permutation at $v_{l}^{a_{g_1}\cdot
\ldots
\cdot a_{g_{k-1}}}$ of $a_{g_k}$ and hence equals to the second multiplier.  The last one equals to the
rooted permutation of the state  $c_{g_k, \epsilon^{\tau}}$ of
$a_{g_k}$, where $\tau$ is the permutation at $v_{l-1}$ of
$a_{g_1}\cdot \ldots
\cdot a_{g_{k-1}}$.
If $l=k-1$ then by inductive hypothesis $\tau=\pi(g_{k-1})$ and
the required permutation equals to the rooted permutation  of the
state $c_{g_k,
\epsilon^{\pi(g_{k-1})}}$ of $a_{g_k}$. Since $i_{k-1}
\ne i_k$ then $\epsilon^{\pi(g_{k-1})}\not\in X_{i_k}$ and the
latter permutation equals $\pi_{g_k}$. By the assumption of
induction if $l>k-1$ then $\tau$ is trivial and $c_{g_k,
\epsilon^{\tau}}=c_{g_k, \epsilon}$. This means that the
permutation  at the vertex $v_l$ of $a_{g_1}\cdot
\ldots \cdot a_{g_k}$ is trivial. This finishes the inductive
step and therefore completes the proof of the theorem.
\end{proof}


\section{Concluding remarks}

To prove that constructed group $A$ (or $B$) admits a
factorization as a free product one may also use generalized
ping-pong lemma (see, for example, \cite{GGO}). That proof uses
the action of $A$ on the boundary of $\mathcal{T}_n$.

Subgroups of $\mathcal{T}_n$, $n \ge 3$  generated by two-state
automorphisms, splitting into the free product of $n-1$ cyclic
groups of order $2$, were presented in \cite{LMOS}.

Constructing faithful actions of free products of finite groups by
finite state automorphisms of rooted trees it is natural to
require that generators have as small number of states as it
possible. The result obtained above is the best possible. Compare
it with the faithful action of free products of finite groups
obtained in \cite{GGO} where the  valency of vertices of the tree
as small as it possible.

The question whether  a self-similar action of the free product of
finite groups, at least one of them having order at least $3$,
exist or not is still open.
